  <p>Concept</p>
</div>
<div class="aboutText">
	<p>I chose to develop this website for my client because I felt this 'Restaurant' layout best fitted the brief. As i researched other food chain websites such as Nando's and KFC I saw that their websites matched or closely matched all the requirements for this project. For example the food menu was basically a gallery in a more complexed but still achievable form. Also how each of their pages had a consistent look and feel as they all are franchises. Due to factors like these it was easy for me to chose what type of website to make for my client. </p>

  <p>Design</p>
</div>
<div class="aboutText">
	<p>When making this website for the client I thought about things that encouraged and discouraged me when using some of my favourite websites such as youtube and twitter and also the other restaurant websites which i had researched. I also thought about things that would invite all types of people to explore the clients restaurant. Things that encouraged me were nice bright colors, sharp images, a clear complexity yet simplicity when using etc. The technicality of these websites helped with the thought process of my design. At the same time i also thought about what discouraged me about those same websites. Things like over-complexity, too many words, no clear structure and unprofessionalism really bothered and discouraged me. Therefore with my design i aimed to embody those same personal preferences which aided my use of these websites. I aimed for a nice color scheme, technicality i.e the use of lightboxes and carousels, symmetry i.e the use of rows and columns and i tried to stay away from unnecessary components. I wanted the website to  be straight to the point and not too distracting.</p>

  <p>Development</p>
</div>
<div class="aboutText">
	<p>My initial approach when designing the website was to do everything manually with only HTML and CSS . I did not think i needed the use of BootStrap and javaScript etc. due to what i now call a "lack of understanding". As i went along i encountered many different issues with my approach and i saw that going about the project that way would eventually leave me running on a tight schedule. Therefore i decided to start making use of Bootstrap and other resources to execute this project. From there issues i had with things such as the positioning of content on my page and making of a carousel and lightbox were quickly solved as for example, the bootstrap had already predefined classes to manipulate. These extra resources also allowed me to even better design out my project by overwriting/manipulating the predefined classes in my style.css file. All in all through various resources including codeAcademy courses i learnt over time i was able to develop this website to meet both the clients standards and the project requirements.</p>

  <p>Testing</p>
</div>
<div class="aboutText">
	<p>To ensure that my website is fully optimal i have inspected it multiple times using google chrome and fixed any errors with the layout after resizing. Through this i have produced media querie(s) to counter any issue that will be presented when using this website on a different device screen. I have sought feedback from fellow classmates and teachers throughout the development of this website and they have over time reccomended to me diffenrent ways to improve the website and how they feel about the website. I believe these different sets of test i've made have helped me build a website which would most definitely please the client and help him to succesfully carry out his business. </p>
